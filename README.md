More testing for bots - based on the poshbot framework at https://github.com/poshbotio/PoshBot

The aim here is to produce a bot that can be called using docker, use regex to invoke commands, automatically build and add required plugins

To begin, the modules here can be used with a dockerfile to add extra built in commands to poshbot so they are immediately available.
